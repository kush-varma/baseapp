This is a base setup for an application which can be used for development.
- It uses Express, MongoDB and handlebars.
Many of us wants to create Node JS application. And everyone spends hours and hours to create just the initial generic app, which includes Login, twitter bootstrap as a front end. Integration with mongodb out of the box. It has Passport js integration to login management. Future releases will have facebook login, general APIs integration and how we can start with google firebase too. This is open source project, any one can use it. I will keep this project open forever so that people dont waste lot of time for initial setup for their application and just dive into making awesome Nodejs Apps.

To get started:
- npm install inside the repository to download all the dependencies module.
- Running MongoDB >=3.2 recommended.
- Models can be found in Model folder, views can be found in Views folder.
- This uses Passport JS for login process and sessions. 
- This App can be used as a boilerplate for your NodeJS MongoDB Express Handlebar Project.
